# LiveScript
is a language which compiles down to JavaScript. It is a fork of [Coco](http://satyr.github.com/coco/), which is in turn derived from [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). Like those two it has a relatively straightforward mapping to JavaScript. LiveScript aims for increased expressiveness and code beauty. LiveScript also allows for an easier transition from CoffeeScript to it in comparison to the transition from CoffeeScript to Coco.
