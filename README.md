# LiveScript
is a fork of [Coco](http://satyr.github.com/coco/), which is in turn derived from [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). Like those two it compiles down to JavaScript. It will encompass various changes which may not be acceptable to the maintainers of Coco. I have thus changed the name from Coco to LiveScript (one of JavaScript's original names) as to avoid confusion between this and Coco on my system.

## Principles
- Do whatever I want.
- Haskell is awesome.
- Compiling to easy to understand JavaScript is less of a priority.

## Differences
###0.1.0
- Renamed everything from Coco and Coke to LiveScript and Slake (have not done file extensions yet). Rational: I want to use both Coco and this on my system. In order for there to be minimal confusion for me, I have renamed this project. Rational for names chosen: LiveScript was the name of JavaScript before it was named JavaScript - thus it seemed like an appropriate name, also few if any other project are named LiveScript. Slake becuase lake was taken and lsake sounds bad.
